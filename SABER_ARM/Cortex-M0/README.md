Implementation of the CCA-secure module lattice-based key encapsulation Saber suitable for ARM Cortex-M0 processors. The goal of this implementation is to reduce the required memory as much as possible. In addition to the cryptosystem as presented to the standardization contest by NIST, we introduced a slightly modified version called Saber# that enables a further decrease of the memory requirements.

## Setup/Benchmarking

After plugging the XMC2Go Infineon board it is enough to run the script `evaluate.py` to get all timing and memory results.
